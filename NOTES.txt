To complement your implementation, write a short note about the problems you
encountered while building this. This might include a list of assumptions you made
during the implementation, problems you had to overlook and shortcuts you took that
you will need to discuss with your designer and product owner when they return.
For example: I’ve assumed thumbnails will always be provided with height 100px and
width 100px. We’ll need to take this into account when generating the thumbnails.

I built the app with PHP(Server-side) and JavaScript(Client-side).

I used Laravel Framework for PHP as it takes off most boiler plate code and
scales nicely. Also, it works fluently with most frontend libraries like React.

For the front end, I used React as it helps to build user interfaces in components,
helping with reusability and also makes application fast with little DOM Manipulation.

For CSS, I used some utility styles from Bootstrap CSS to style the forms and buttons
due to the time limit.

Challenges

Due to time limit, there were aspects of the system I would have loved to work on
but could not, due to time constraint:

1) Tests- Automated tests for Client side and Server side
2) Confirmation dialog before deleting a page
3) Avoid redirect loops within pages
4) Support for older browsers and better responsiveness

Installation

To install the project, the following steps should be taken

1) Copy or unzip files to the Server
2) Set up .env file at the root of the application.
    Most importantly, the following should be filled in the .env for the app to function
    correctly:

    APP_NAME

    #No trailing slash
    APP_URL=http://localhost/wikiNew/public

    #Same format as below. Starts with a slash. No trailing slash after
    APP_PUBLIC_DIRECTORY="/wikiNew/public"

    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=wikinewdb
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
  3) Run app from the terminal with:
      php artisan serve --port=8142
